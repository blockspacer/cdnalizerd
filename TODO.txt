# Todo

## Watcher

* Have rename show the full paths
* Watch sub dirs that are mv'd in from outside

## General

* Light scan - compares file lists to those on the server. Can be run every hour
* Medium scan - compares file mtimes to server metadata - Called on startup
* Deep scan - compares file MD5s to those on the server - only called on demand (probably through a signal)
* Heartbeat - When in a glusterfs setup, communicate with other daemons, to spread the load and not double up on work.

## RS API

* Store mtimes and checksums in the file metadata
* Add AuthURL config file setting

# Done

* Add config reader tests - DONE
* experiment with rax-login - DONE
