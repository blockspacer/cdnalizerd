## Watcher

* Links:
  + Version 1:
    - Ignore delete events on both symlinks and hardlinks
    - Igonre move events on both symlinks and hardlinks
    - This is because we don't get notified when a link is created, nor when a hardlinks partner is edited
  + Version 2 (maybe):
    - Start watching the destination of directory symlinks created here
    - Start watching the original(s) of hardlinked and simlinked files created here

## General

* Light scan - compares file lists to those on the server. Can be run every hour
* Medium scan - compares file mtimes to server metadata - Called on startup
* Deep scan - compares file MD5s to those on the server - only called on demand (probably through a signal)
* Heartbeat - When in a glusterfs setup, communicate with other daemons, to spread the load and not double up on work.

## RS API

* Store mtimes and checksums in the file metadata
* Add AuthURL config file setting

# Wolf's comments

 * INOTIFY is a QUEUE - so just have all the workers read from it.
 * Forget server side move now

 * Queue per endpoint
   + Named workers
   + 2 per queue
